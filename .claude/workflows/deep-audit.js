- Cleanliness: dead code, unused imports/exports, unreachable branches, commented-out code, forgotten debug logs, stale TODOs
- DRY: logic repeated 3+ times that should be shared (do NOT flag a 2nd occurrence or a single-use "could extract" — that is noise)
- Consistency: the same concern handled differently across peers (error handling, validation, response shaping)
- Naming, premature abstraction, oversized modules/functions
- Type-safety gaps (any, unchecked casts, missing null handling at boundaries)
- Also flag any clear correctness / security / performance bug you trip over — do not suppress a real bug because the emphasis is cleanliness.`

${CHECKLIST}

Two-pass rule: after your first sweep, re-verify every finding by reading the actual code and tracing call sites. Return ONLY findings you re-confirmed. For each, give exact file path, line, the evidence that proves it, and the reliable fix. Your output is data for a verification stage, not prose — be precise and concrete.`

SCOPE (read these end-to-end): ${scope}

${CHECKLIST}

Read the files in scope completely — do not skim, do not guess from names. When a finding depends on a caller/peer outside your scope, note it but only assert what you can verify.

Two-pass rule: after your first sweep, re-verify every finding by reading the actual code and tracing call sites. Discard anything you cannot confirm. Return ONLY survivors, each with exact file path, line, the evidence, and the reliable fix. Your output is data for a verification stage, not prose.`

  severity: ${f.severity}

Open the cited file and the surrounding code. Try to prove the finding WRONG: maybe the "dead" code is reachable, the "duplication" is actually used once, the "bug" is prevented by an upstream guarantee, the line/claim doesn't match reality, or it's a deliberate pattern used consistently elsewhere.

Set refuted=true if the finding does not hold up OR you cannot independently confirm it from the code. Only set refuted=false when you have read the code and the finding is unambiguously real. Default to refuted=true when uncertain.`

Do two things:
1. DEDUPE — the same issue often surfaces from multiple shards (a vertical reviewer and a thematic one). Merge findings that share a root cause or the same file:line; when merging, list every affected file in the detail.
2. TIER by blast radius into P0–P3:
   - P0: data loss, security, auth bypass, money
   - P1: correctness bugs that will ship to users
   - P2: UX problems users notice but won't break things
   - P3: code quality, naming, DRY, dead code, comments
   (Re-tier if a finding's self-assigned severity is wrong.)

Return the deduped, tiered findings plus a one-paragraph summary of the codebase's overall cleanliness state. Keep each finding's exact file/line and suggested_fix intact.`
